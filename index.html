      <p>These two are my babies. Found in the raging desert that was, New Jersey in August. These two have inspired me to become the best cat daddy ever. </p>

        <p>It all started with guinea pigs. Yes. Guinea pigs. My little sister wanted a guinea pig for some inexpicable reason and spent months campaigning for them. My mom eventually relented and agreed to get her 2 guinea pigs. My girlfriend and I tagged along to check out the cute animals at the shelter. (who wouldn't?) This shelter had rooms where you could go in and interact with the animals there. Obviously, I chose to go towards the kitten room.</p>

        <p>It was there, that I met Cassie. She was standing behind the glass door staring at this toy that she slid out from under the door and into the hallway. (To be honest, I saw the toy first and wondered why it was there, and then Cassie who was named Rachel at the time.) Being the kind wonderful and curious person that I am, I flicked the toy back under the door into the room. Cassie chased after it and was playing around with it for a bit before sending it right back out to me. We did this a few more times before my girlfriend and little sister came by. At first, they were wondering why I was on the floor and staring into this room. Then, they saw me catching and sending back this little toy and it all clicked. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Eventually, a staff member saw us and asked me if I wanted to go into the kitty room. I didn't hesitate at all. When we went into the room, Cassie was all over me. Sniffing, pawing, climbing, and being super adorable. I originally didn't want to adopt a cat, but I couldn't resist anymore. When we were going through the process, they explained that if we adopt Cassie, we can also adopt another cat from the litter and they'd waive the adoption fee. While we were deciding between another black kitten (named Chandler) and this grey kitten (named Monica, you can tell that this was the Friends litter), the grey kitty stuck her face into this little hoop tube thing from this mini cat tree and got her face stuck. It was a sign. And thus, we adopted Minnie Cat along with Cassie.</p>
